## Introduction/Business Problem

- Uniqueness and quality of food can vary geographically
    - cities have a plethora of unique tastes
    - rural areas often have fewer options
    
- Should be taken into consideration by chefs and restaurateurs
    - Should a chef open a restaurant in a city, or a small town
    - Could there be demand for my food here
    
    
## Data

- Demographic data on all counties in California
    - Median income, population density, voter registration data 

- Restaurant data from the county seat of each county
    - Price, rating, type, location

- New metric: Uniqueness
    - Measures how unique a given county seat's cuisine is, relative to other county seats


## Exploration/Methodology

- Look at how the variables of interest vary by county

- Use linear regression to quantify relationships between average rating, and demographic factors

- Use economic and demographic theory to put the data and trends into context


## Results: Geographic Trends

## Results: Uniqueness

## Discussion

- Demographics related to rating and uniqueness
    - Urban areas have higher average rating and uniqueness scores
    - The above is also true for high income areas
    
- These relationships make economic sense
    - Chefs and restaurateurs serve high quality cuisine to customers who are likely to purchase their food 
    - Urban areas are also going to have markets where there is demand for unique cuisines
    
- They also make demographic sense
    - Urban areas tend to me more ethnically diverse
    - Leads to more unique food choices, relative to rural areas
    
## Conclusion

- Because these results are based in economics and demography, they generalize to places outside California
    - For example, we'd expect New York to have high quality, unique tastes (and it does)

- Recommendation: Chefs and restaurateurs should look at the demographics and economic state of the market they are considering entrance to, and make decisions based off of that
    - Also look at similar restaurants in that area, if there are any
